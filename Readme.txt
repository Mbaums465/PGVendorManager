https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/#description &  py -m auto_py_to_exe is how I created the exe. 
The program is really a timer-manager. If you don't reset it and keep the data up to date, you are in trouble. 
I am allowing for entered times to be greater than 7 days so that you can track work orders.
